## 🤔 Why HC Soundbox?

In an era of streaming services and smartphone apps, there's something special about a **physical music player you built yourself**.

### The Motivation
- 🎧 **Tangible music experience** — Physical controls beat touchscreens for music control
- 🛠️ **Learn by building** — Great project for understanding ESP32, I2S audio, displays, and FreeRTOS tasks
- 📵 **Distraction-free listening** — No notifications, no apps, just music
- 🎨 **Customizable** — Browse any folder structure, play any MP3 or WAV file
- 💰 **Affordable** — Build a unique music player for under $20

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HimC29/hc-soundbox.git
cd hc-soundbox

## 🎮 How to Use

### Mode Select

On boot you’ll see a **Select Mode** menu:
- **SD Card**: browse and play files from microSD
- **Bluetooth**: stream audio from your phone (A2DP)

### SD Card Mode (How to play music)

1. Insert a **FAT32**-formatted microSD card with `.mp3` / `.wav` files.
2. From **Select Mode**, choose **SD Card**.
3. **Browse** with the rotary encoder:
   - Rotate = move selection up/down
   - Press = enter a folder / play a file
4. While playing:
   - Rotate = change volume
   - Press = pause / resume
   - Back = stop playback and return to the file browser
5. In the file browser:
   - Back = go up one directory (and from SD root, back returns to mode select)

### Bluetooth Mode (How to connect)

1. Select **Bluetooth** in the mode menu.
2. On your phone/PC, open Bluetooth devices and pair/connect to **`HC Soundbox`**.
3. Start playing audio — the ESP32 acts as a **Bluetooth A2DP speaker**.
4. Back button returns you to the mode menu.

### Navigation Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Rotate encoder** | Scroll up/down in menus / Adjust volume (SD + Bluetooth) |
| **Press encoder** | Select menu item / Enter folder / Play selected file / Pause & Resume (SD) |
| **Back button** | Go back (SD: up directory / stop playback, BT: mode menu) |

### Playback Screen

While a song is playing, the display shows:
- Scrolling song title
- Current position / total length progress bar
- Current volume level
- Pause/Resume button indicator

### Auto-Advance

When a song finishes, the player automatically plays the next file in the current directory. It wraps back to the first file after the last one.

---

## 📂 Music Organization

The file browser mirrors your SD card's folder structure exactly — no special naming required.

```
SD Card Root/
├── Rock/
│   ├── song1.mp3
│   └── song2.wav
├── Jazz/
│   └── track1.mp3
└── favourite.mp3
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** Only `.mp3` and `.wav` files are playable. Other file types are visible in the browser but cannot be selected for playback.

## 💻 Software Architecture

The project is structured as a PlatformIO C++ project with the following modules:

```
src/
├── main.cpp          — Setup, loop, and page state machine
├── bt/
│   ├── bt.cpp         — Bluetooth A2DP sink mode (connect/stream/volume sync)
│   └── bt.h
├── display/
│   ├── display.cpp    — OLED rendering (menus, SD screens, Bluetooth screen)
│   └── display.h
├── globals/
│   ├── globals.cpp    — Shared state definitions (pins, display, volume, etc.)
│   └── globals.h      — Shared state declarations
├── helpers/
│   ├── helpers.cpp    — Rotary + small helpers
│   └── helpers.h
├── sd/
│   ├── sdAudio.cpp    — SD audio playback plumbing
│   ├── sdAudio.h
│   ├── sdGlobals.cpp  — SD-related shared state
│   ├── sdGlobals.h
│   ├── sdMenu.cpp     — SD file browser UI logic
│   ├── sdMenu.h
│   ├── sdState.cpp    — SD mode state machine
│   └── sdState.h
└── scrollText/
    ├── scrollText.cpp — Scrolling text animation helpers
    └── scrollText.h
```

### Key Implementation Details

- **FreeRTOS audio task** — Audio decoding runs on Core 0 via `xTaskCreatePinnedToCore`, keeping the UI responsive on Core 1
- **Pause/Resume** — Saves the byte position in the file (`source->getPos()`) and seeks back on resume
- **Song length** — Parsed directly from WAV headers (`fmt`/`data` chunks) and MP3 Xing/Info VBR headers, with a 128kbps CBR fallback
- **Scrolling display** — Long filenames and directory paths scroll automatically on the OLED
- **Bounce2 debouncing** — All buttons use hardware debouncing via the Bounce2 library
- **Bluetooth A2DP sink** — Bluetooth audio is handled in `bt/` using `ESP32-A2DP` with queued I2S output
- **Phone volume sync** — When the connected device changes volume, AVRCP volume change callbacks update the ESP32 `volume` value and refresh the UI

### Libraries Used

- `ESP8266Audio` — I2S audio decoding for MP3 and WAV
- `Adafruit_GFX` + `Adafruit_SSD1306` — OLED display driver
- `Bounce2` — Button debouncing
- `ESP32-A2DP` — Bluetooth A2DP audio sink (streaming from phone)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No sound from speaker
- Check I2S DAC wiring (BCLK → 26, LRC → 25, DIN → 27)
- Verify the DAC module is powered correctly
- Confirm the file format is `.mp3` or `.wav`

### Bluetooth device not showing up / can’t pair
- Make sure you selected **Bluetooth** mode in the mode menu (it only advertises/acts as a speaker in BT mode)
- Remove/forget **HC Soundbox** from your phone’s Bluetooth list and try pairing again
- Reboot the ESP32 and retry

### Bluetooth connects but no audio
- Confirm your phone is actually outputting audio to **HC Soundbox** (check the audio output route)
- Try starting playback after the connection finishes
- If you were previously in SD mode, go back to the mode menu and re-enter Bluetooth mode

### Phone volume changes don’t update the ESP32 volume
- Some phones/players don’t send AVRCP absolute volume updates in all cases; try changing volume from the system volume buttons (not in-app)
- Reconnect Bluetooth and try again

### OLED display not working
- Verify I2C address is `0x3C` (run an I2C scanner sketch to confirm)
- If I2C address is not `0x3C`, change the value of DISPLAY_ADDRESS found near the end of [globals.cpp](src/globals/globals.cpp)
- Check SDA/SCL connections to GPIO 21/22

### SD card not detected
- Ensure the card is formatted as **FAT32**
- Check SPI wiring (CS → GPIO 5)
- Try a different SD card or re-seat the card

### Songs not advancing automatically
- Check Serial Monitor for error messages from the audio task
- Ensure the next file in the directory is a supported format
